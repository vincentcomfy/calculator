1. Set Up Display Logic (First Priority):

    Store User Input: Implement a variable (currentInput) to store the current number being typed by the user.
    Display Updates: Make sure the display reflects this input whenever a user clicks a number button.
    Prevent Overflow: Handle the case where the number exceeds the screen's display capacity by limiting the number of digits shown or handling rounding.

2. Handle Number Button Clicks:

    Button Actions: Set up event listeners for each number button (0–9) so that when a user clicks a number, it’s added to currentInput.
    Update the Display: Every time the user clicks a number, the display should update with the new currentInput.

3. Handle Decimal Button:

    Prevent Multiple Decimals: Add logic to prevent adding more than one decimal point. If there's already a decimal point in the currentInput, disable or ignore the decimal button press.
    Display Decimal: If the user presses the decimal button and the input is valid (i.e., no existing decimal), add the decimal point to currentInput.

4. Operator Logic:

    Store First Number and Operator: When an operator (+, -, ×, ÷) is pressed, save the currentInput as the first number (firstNumber) and store the operator in a variable (operator).
    Reset Input for Next Number: Clear or reset the currentInput so that the user can input the second number.

5. Handle Second Number and Equals Button:

    Store Second Number: When the second number is entered, store it in secondNumber.
    Execute the Operation: When the equals button (=) is pressed, call the operate() function, passing firstNumber, secondNumber, and operator.
    Display the Result: After performing the operation, display the result on the screen. Make sure to handle rounding or truncating large numbers appropriately.

6. Clear Functionality:

    Clear Screen and Variables: When the "Clear" (C) button is pressed, reset all values (firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, currentInput) and clear the display, showing "0" or an empty state.
    Clear-All (CA): This should reset everything to the starting state, including any intermediate results.

7. Error Handling (Division by Zero):

    Handle Divide by Zero: Add an if-statement to catch the case where the user tries to divide by zero. Display an error message ("Cannot divide by zero" or something snarky) and prevent further operations until the user clears the screen.

8. Backspace Button:

    Undo Last Input: When the backspace button is pressed, remove the last character from currentInput and update the display. If currentInput becomes empty, reset it to '0'.

9. Multiple Operations Logic (Chaining Operations):

    Sequential Operations: Ensure that after an operation is completed, the result is used as the first number for the next calculation. For example, if the user presses 12 + 7 = 19, and then they press - 5, the new calculation should start with 19 - 5.

10. Keyboard Support (Optional, for Extra Credit):

    Capture Keyboard Inputs: Add event listeners for keypresses to allow the calculator to accept keyboard input (e.g., digits, operators, and the equals button).
    Map Keys to Buttons: Ensure that each key corresponds to the appropriate button action.

11. Polish and Refine:

    Test for Bugs: Make sure the calculator handles edge cases (e.g., pressing = without completing an input or pressing multiple operators in a row).
    Refine UI/UX: Adjust visual feedback (hover, active, etc.), handle decimal precision, and add extra features like the snarky error message or a rounded result display.
